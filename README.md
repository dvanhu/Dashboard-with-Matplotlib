#  Advanced Dashboard with Matplotlib

A visually rich, professional-level static dashboard built using **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Pandas**. This project demonstrates how to combine multiple chart types into a single dashboard layout and render it as a high-quality `.png` image for reporting and analysis.

---

##  Overview

This project uses Pythonâ€™s Matplotlib `GridSpec` layout to display multiple data visualizationsâ€”line plot, bar chart, pie chart, and scatter plotâ€”all in one structured layout. It is ideal for static reporting, analytics presentations, and building your portfolio as a data analyst or Python developer.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Format (data.csv)

This project expects a basic CSV format with the following sample structure. You can replace this with your own relevant dataset and modify the plotting logic accordingly:

```csv
Year,Sales,Profit,Region,Category
2018,120,30,North,Tech
2019,150,45,South,Office
2020,180,60,East,Furniture
2021,200,70,West,Tech
2022,210,90,North,Furniture
```
You can use any dataset, just make sure the columns match your visualization requirements in dashboard.py.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dvanhu/Dashboard-with-Matplotlib.git
cd Dashboard-with-Matplotlib
```

2. **Install Required Packages**

```bash
pip install matplotlib pandas seaborn
```

3. **Run the Dashboard Script**

```bash
python dashboard.py
```

The output will be saved as `Dashboard_With_Matplotlib.png` in the same directory.

## **Tech Stack**

| Technology   | Purpose                          |
|--------------|----------------------------------|
| Python 3.x   | Main programming language        |
| Pandas       | CSV data handling                |
| Matplotlib   | Core charting & layout framework |
| Seaborn      | Chart styling & enhancement      |

## **What You'll Learn**

- Using GridSpec to organize multiple subplots  
- Loading and preprocessing CSV data using pandas  
- Enhancing chart readability with seaborn  
- Exporting static charts as `.png` for offline use  
- Styling charts using custom color palettes, titles, and legends  

## **Sample Visualizations**

- **Line Plot**: Sales trend over years  
- **Bar Chart**: Profit by region  
- **Pie Chart**: Category distribution  
- **Scatter Plot**: Correlation between sales and profit  

All visualizations are customized for better clarity and are arranged in a clean dashboard layout.
