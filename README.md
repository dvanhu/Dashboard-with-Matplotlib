# Dashboard-with-Matplotlib
This project demonstrates how to build a visually engaging and informative data dashboard using Matplotlib. Multiple types of charts (line, bar, pie, scatter) are arranged using GridSpec to present complex data in a clean, organized layout. The dashboard is generated as a single static image, ideal for reports, presentations, or data storytelling.
